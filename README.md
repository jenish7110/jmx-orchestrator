# jmx-orchestrator
JMX Orchestrator is a UI-based JMeter scenario editor inspired by LoadRunner Controller. It allows performance testers to visually scale users, adjust TPS, switch execution modes, enable/disable thread groups, modify timers, and download a fully updated JMX — all without opening JMeter.
